# Beginner Bondage Workshop
### A 101 on Shibari by DoodleMe & KnottyLola (FetLife)

## Example Consent Questions

- What is the purpose of the scene? … Instructional?  Demonstration?  Exploratory?  Photography?  Foreplay to sex?
- What do you intend to tie? Share and explain
- What mood? … Playful?  Serious?  Sensual?  Demanding?  Dark?
- How proprietary do you want this scene to be? … If you need them to be in a certain position or place … Will you ask them to move?  Order them?  Physically force them to move where you want them to be?
- What is their role? … Are they a stranger to you?  Are they a play partner?  A lover?  A spouse?
- How do they want to be treated? … As a respected partner?  As a gift?  As prey?  As an object?
- What are the rules of contact? … Will you be minimizing contact, touching their skin with yours only when absolutely necessary?  Will it mostly be only the rope that touches them?  Will you be casually and comfortably brushing their skin as you tie?  Will you be all up in their business, teasing and tormenting them as you tie, i.e. the more touch the better?
- Is sex planned to be part of the scene? If yes, how do you define sex? For this workshop, no.
